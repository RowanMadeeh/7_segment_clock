# 7_segment_clock
This readme file provides information about the 7-Segment Clock project, which utilizes a 7-segment driver and a DIO (Digital Input/Output) driver to display the time on a 7-segment display. This project aims to create a simple clock using these components.

Components Used
1) 7-segment driver: This component is responsible for controlling the segments of the 7-segment display. It takes input signals to determine which segments to illuminate, allowing the display of digits and characters.
2) DIO driver: The Digital Input/Output driver is used to interface the 7-segment driver with a microcontroller or any other digital system. It helps in sending the appropriate signals to control the 7-segment driver.
